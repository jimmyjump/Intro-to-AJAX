# Intro to AJAX

###### Making Asynchronous Requests with jQuery

In this course you will learn how to make **asynchronous requests** with **JavaScript** (using jQuery’s AJAX functionality), and gain a better understanding of what’s actually happening when you do so.

 You will also learn how to use **data APIs** so you can take advantage of *freely accessible data in your applications*, including **photo results**, **news articles** and up-to-date data about the world around us.

Next page button has mostly disappeared from the web. Modern web pages can load content without reloading the whole page. All thanks to **AJAX** (*Asynchronous JavaScript and XML*). **AJAX** allows data to be loaded asynchronously. They happen in the background without blocking the rest of the page. **Twetting**, **Scrolling newsfeed on Twitter**, **Posting a new status on Facebook**, **Viewing friends pictures on Facebook** are all examples of **AJAX** in real word pages/apps.

We are going to build **Move Planner App** in this course. It will use data from [**Google Street View**](https://www.google.com/streetview/), [**Wikipedia**](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) and [**New York Times**](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

Necessary Components Of An AJAX Request ?
You only need a URL for an AJAX request.

Facebook and Twitter use their own internal APIs.
But, luckily there are a lot of public APIs on the web that serve interesting data for free.

YouTube API, Flickr API, Twitter API, GitHub API, Maps API, Reddit API are some examples of publicly available APIs.
